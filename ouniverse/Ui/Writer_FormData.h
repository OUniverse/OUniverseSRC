## UiManager

> **Singleton Service: Created once only by the boot process.**

The UiManager is a service singleton which manages all user interface elements (UI).

#### IO
IO is used here as an abbreviation for Interface Object and is any menu component
* A menu IO can be made up of many smaller IOs.

#### Tasks:
* Coordinates all of the UI's IO elements.
* Allows the IO elements to register with other systems (For example the console registering for the console CommandC).
* Activates each IO so that they bind themselves to the actual UI.
* Provides functions for other parts of the program to trigger UI events like popup notifications or data ribbons.

**Creator:** UBoot
**Holder:** Major
