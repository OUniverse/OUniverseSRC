## Server

> **Singleton Service: Created once only by the boot process.**

A service singleton which provides a layer between input and action.

* This is dabbling in the potential for some remote multiplayer by having a gathering spot for inputs and actions.
* Ideally this can be used to allow a second player to join the game by having both players receiving outcomes from
	this server code running on the initial player's computer.

**Creator:** Not Implemented (Will be Boot)
**Holder:** Not Implemented (Will be Major)
